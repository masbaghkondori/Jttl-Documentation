**Apache Camel** 
###Camel is a Java library to routing and mediation,so you can easily wire up tests in whatever unit testing framework you use (JUnit 3.x (deprecated), 4.x, or TestNG). However the Camel project has tried to make the testing of Camel as easy and powerful as possible so we have introduced the following features.
camel-test module has been introduced to test your Enterprise Integration Patterns###

first step:**

###A simple example on youtube:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZE-YSHK_gw  - automatic!
###Apache Camel is a mediation.
###Features: It has component make interacting between many endpoiints very simple.It moves and transforms messages between endpoints like FTPS, Twitter, etc.

From JMS system to another file system
From servlet Api to JMS message 
It means Apach Camel Transforms or moves between two endpoints and on its way can do  some functions like  Filtering, routing, logging or tracking, changing format.
There are so many endpoints/components like :Google Calander, Google Drive FTPS, Twitter etc.
Here is a link to list of endpoints:
http://camel.apache.org/component-list.html
And every endpoints has own APIs or function to action between that endpoint and another one.
For example: This statement read something from whatever  to Twitter.
Searching using a producer with static keywords
from("direct:foo")
  .to("twitter://search?keywords=camel&consumerKey=[s]&consumerSecret=[s]&accessToken=[s]&accessTokenSecret=[s]");
 
 
''' For example: '''
###If you want to ###
####moving a file or message from the file system like FTPS####
*1.searching a file in a file system
1.moving it back to Twitter 
1.We don’t need to know how twitter works. or understand that API, 
1.Every one of endpoints supports many parameters like type, move, and so on*
To do addressing to endpoints is used a “from” and a “to”
Between any “from”  and “to” we can do any steps like .process or .transform or whatever you want.####
